We propose a new bio-inspired edge detection model which aims at suppressing texture edges and integrating boundaries of texture regions. We innovatively introduce the texture gradient into the proposed model by integrating it with the response of simple cells, which can effectively highlight the boundaries of texture regions and suppress texture edges. The proposed hierarchical model includes the retina, LGN, V1, V2, and V4. In the V1, edge responses are regulated by a new surround modulation mechanism and incorporated with texture gradients for significant edges while suppressing texture edges. In the V2, the endpoint cells are simulated to suppress the response of edges. We report the results on three public benchmarks, i.e., BSDS500 (ODS F-score of 0.73), MBDD (ODS F-score of 0.84 for lower-level edge annotation), and NYUD (ODS F-score of 0.64). The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art as the non-learning method. A detailed description of the model can be found in our paper.
